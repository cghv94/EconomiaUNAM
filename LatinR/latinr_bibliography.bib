	abstract = {learnr 0.10.1 New features Minor new features and improvements learnr gained the function learnr::tutorial\_package\_dependencies(), used to enumerate a tutorial's R package dependencies. Front-ends can use this to ensure a tutorial's dependencies are satisfied before attempting to run that tutorial. learnr::available\_tutorials() gained the column package\_dependencies containing the required packages to run the document. (\#329) Include vignette about publishing learnr tutorials on shinyapps.io learnr's built-in tutorials now come with a description as part of the YAML header, with the intention of this being used in front-end software that catalogues available learnr tutorials on the system. (\#312) Add session\_start and session\_stop events. (\#311) Bug fixes Fixed a bug where broken exercise code created non-"length-one character vector". (\#311) Fixed extra parameter documentation bug for CRAN. (\#323) Fixed video initialization error caused by a jQuery version increase in Shiny. (\#326) Fixed progressive reveal bug where the next section would not be displayed unless refreshed. (\#330) Fixed a bug where topics would not be loaded if they contained non-ascii characters.

	abstract = {Welcome to R packages by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan. Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data. In this book you’ll learn how to turn your code into packages that others can easily download and use. Writing a package can seem overwhelming at first. So start with the basics and improve it over time. It doesn’t matter if your first version isn’t perfect as long as the next version is better.},
